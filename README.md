An Transport Company's application to accept Fuel expenditure by company's drivers. 

The application's over view can be classified into two: 

1. Upload 
2. Retrieve Records/ View Spend Trends 


The Upload section can be classified into two further sub-divisions: 

    1. Upload One Instance of a record at a time 
    2. Upload Bulk/multi-part records through a file. 
    
    
The Retrieval Section has many views: 
    
    1. Spend In a month 
    2. Spend by Fuel Type 
    3. Spend by User/Driver 
    4. Spend Across Drivers & Fuel Types 
    

To access the upload section, I have configured the Landing page on Upload i.e. 
    
    - http://127.0.0.1:8000/upload/ 

Access to Analytics view has been configured to : 
    
    - http:// 127.0.0.1:8000/trends/
    
    
More to come.
